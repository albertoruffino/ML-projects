# Gender Classification from Height and Weight

A simple **PyTorch neural network** that predicts gender based on height and weight.  
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization including:

- Training & test accuracy plots
- Confusion matrix for model performance
- Scatter plots comparing true vs predicted labels

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains three columns:

- **Height** (inches)
- **Weight** (pounds)
- **Gender** (`Male` or `Female`)

Dataset URL: [Heights, Weights, Genders CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnmyleswhite/ML_for_Hackers/master/02-Exploration/data/01_heights_weights_genders.csv)
